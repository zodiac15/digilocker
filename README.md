# **Digilocker: A Digital Locker with Advanced Encryption Technology**


**Introduction**

Currently, in India, almost all of the government issued documents are in physical form across the country. This means every time a resident needs to share the document with an agency to avail any service, an attested photo copy either in physical form or on scanned form is shared. Use of physical copies of document creates huge overhead in terms of manual verification, paper storage, manual audits, etc. incurring high cost and inconvenience. This creates problem for various agencies to verify the authenticity of these documents, thus, creating loopholes for usage of fake documents/certificates. Due to the nature of these documents not having a strong identity attached to it, anyone with same name can indeed misuse someone else&#39;s document.

Secured Digi Locker is an advanced application in which the file storing makes it very efficient and reliable as we don&#39;t have to carry each and every document with us every time. Legal document such as Passport, Birth Certificate etc. are very important and it can be misused. Uploading it to any server is a risk taking action as it can be hacked and keep it in our phone is also dangerous. Therefore, we have developed a system that saves the uploaded document in an encrypted form and stores it in the Internal Memory, to avoid any kind of hacking internal or external.

The main advantage of this system is that it asks for Secure Pin to access the file which we enter while registering ourselves. Secure pin ensures that if our phone is in someone&#39;s hand they won&#39;t be able to access the files. The files are secured in many ways which no intruder can access them in any case. We make uses of SQLite as it&#39;s backend to support the application.


**Pros** 
1. The Cost of Providing the Service
2. Quick turnaround time
3. Reduce Frauds
4. e-Sign
5. Comparison with Private Cloud Storage Services
6. Anytime Anywhere Access

**Problem formulation/Objectives:**

Objectives of such digital repository solution are:

1. Eliminate need for the residents to maintain hard copy of government issued documents.
2. Eliminate need for the residents to produce (in hard format) government issued documents, while applying for services.
3. Provide secure and consented access of government issued documents to user agencies.
4. Ensure all the documents issued to the residents are available to him/her anywhere anytime, in a standard format which can be shared with any other department.
5. Provide an open, interoperable, multi-provider architecture to ensure departments and states have flexibility to use best document repository for their purposes.
6. Provide an architecture that can support well structured future documents as well as a mechanism to digitize older documents that may not have machine readable formats.
7. Provide a default portal and mobile application for residents to view their documents in a consolidated way.
